const : can not be changed

var : was used earlier but because of scope issue (no scope boundries) it is not in use

let : instead of var , now var is being used and it respects the scope boundries

"use strict" :  it is writen at the top of the file to declare that this code is the newer version of the Js
              note the older one


alert("some thing") : it is used to pop up in the browser
